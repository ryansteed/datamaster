# 30 Oct 18 - Metric Demo

## Plan
LS: lots of background research into metric, final plan for metric
NS: 
- mathematical write up of metric
- try the metric with three different weights:
    + quality
    + custom centrality from You
    + H-index

## Metric Definition

### Models for my metric
####  [Forward Importance](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10438599700000006?needAccess=true)
$$IMPORTF_i = nciting_i + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{nciting_i}nciting_{i+1,j}$$

#### [Backwards Importance (Persistence)](../literature/Matinelli_Nomaler_2014.pdf)
$$persistence_i = \sum_{j=1}^{nendpoints_i} \frac{1}{ncited_{i+1,j}}$$

### Potential weighting indices
#### H-index
Where $f(i)$ is the number of citations for patent $i$:
$$H = max_i [min (f(i), i)]$$

####  [Quality](../literature/Lanjouw_et_al-2004-The_Economic_Journal.pdf)
For $k$ quality indicators with empirical value regressions:
- forward cites
- backward cites
- claims
- family size

$$quality_i = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^4 \mu_k + \lambda_kq_i + \beta'X_i + e_{ki}}{k}$$

####  [Custom centrality measure](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-017-2252-y)
Given centrality measures $C$:
- $C_1$ is degree centrality
- $C_2$ is betweenness centrality
- $C_3$ is eigenvector centrality
- $C_4$ is closeness centrality

Where $N$ is the set of all nodes:
$$C_x^+ = Max(C_x(i))$$
$$C_x^- = Min(C_x(i))$$
$$Var(X) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}{n}$$
$$Var_T = \sum_{x=1}^4 Var(C_x)$$
$$W_x = \frac{Var(C_x)}{Var_T}$$
$$S^+(i) = \sqrt{\sum_{x=1}^4 W_x(C_x(i)-C_x^+)^2}$$
$$S^-(i) = \sqrt{\sum_{x=1}^4 W_x(C_x(i)-C_x^-)^2}$$
$$C(i) = \frac{S^-(i)}{S^+(i) + S^-(i)}$$

## Importance of Knowledge Contribution / Persistence Metric
Where $B$ is one of the weighting indices above:
$$K_i(root) = \frac{B_i}{p(i, root)} + \sum_{j=1}^{nciting} k_{i+1,j}$$

Note that the function $p(i, root)$ is the persistence index with respect to the root node being evaluated. $p(root, root) = 1$, but in all other cases $p(i, root) = ncited_i$.

Thus the knowledge contribution of some root node $r$ is simply:
$$K_r = K_i(r)$$

## Simha

For each root node - adjust for year relative to root (not absolute time)

What is the average track for a patent's influence?

Bonus: Do some absolute years stand out?? Combo relative and absolute

Bonus: Network effect...
