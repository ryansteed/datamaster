Set up conda env `datamaster`

Running code in jupyter

Using patent network https://snap.stanford.edu/data/cit-Patents.html


Created small network of pre-1999 citation data

Also parsed to Pandas part of the most recent application data from the USPTO

Doesn't contain any citation info!!!


How did NBER originally munge citation data??
